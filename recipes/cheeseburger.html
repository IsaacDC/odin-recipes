<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade cheeseburgers. An absolute summertime staple.

        And it doesn’t require anything fancy. Just some good ole’ 80/20 ground chuck, 
        salt and pepper (seasoning is absolute key here) and the most epic burger sauce 
        to take your burger to the next level.
        
        Serve with desired toppings (all the bread and butter pickles for me) 
        on toasted brioche hamburger buns. And don’t forget to snag some good 
        quality American cheese (or your favorite kind of cheese if American 
        cheddar isn’t your thing).
